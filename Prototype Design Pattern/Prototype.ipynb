    "- Creational Design Pattern\n",
    "- Create new objects by copying an existing object(prototype).\n",

    "## When to use Prototype Design Pattern?\n",
    "- Expensive Object Creation\n",
    "- Complex Object Initialization\n",
    "- Avoid Subclassing\n",
    "- Immutable Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to Implement\n",
    "- Create prototype interface, declare `.Clone()` method\n",
    "- Prototype class must define alternative constructor\n",
    "- Every class must explicitly override the cloning method\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pros and Cons\n",
    "### Pros\n",
    "- Can clone objects without coupling to their concrete classes.\n",
    "- Can get rid of repeated initialization code in favor of cloning pre-built prototypes.\n",
    "- Can produce complex objects more conveniently.\n",
    "- Get an alternative to inheritance when dealing with configuration presets for complex objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cons\n",
    "- Cloning complex objects that have circular references might be very tricky.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prototype Vs Factory Method\n",
    "- Prototype is used to create new instance by cloning a existing object.\n",
    "Factory method is used to create objects but leave the specific object creation to subclasses.\n",
