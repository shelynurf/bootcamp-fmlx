    "- Create a new object, then go through all the fields of the original object and copy their values over to the new object.\n",
    "- But some object field may be private\n",
    "- Sometimes we only know the interface that the object follow, but not the concrete class\n",

    "- Declares a common interface for all objects that support cloning that lets you clone an object without coupling your code to the class of that object.\n",
